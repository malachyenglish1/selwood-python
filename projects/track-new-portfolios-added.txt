- pull the relevant xml/excel for all four funds

- TradeReport has all of the trade descriptions (column F: 'Description') and maturities (column B: 'Maturity')
- Column A ('TradeId') and fund ('') can be used to map to other reports

- Produce an unique list of all TradeIds

? How do I see how this compares to the last report ?

- Just check the difference in TradeId's.  
- Can then get a list of new ID's and can map add'l data that 
we want from these IDs from other reports (or the DetailedReport)

- Use the Trade file:

- Simply pull the 'TradeID' and 'Trade Date'
'Maturity', 'Counterparty', 'Description', 'Notional', 'InitialMargin', 'Attach', 'Detach'

- Filter this on the date from last Fri

- Use the Portfolio_Positions file in QUINTILLION\Update to pull the traded spread 
(column I)
